Gamification of Cities

Team Members:

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Vision: To make cities sustainable by boosting their local economy

Goal: Encourage citizens to support local businesses in their respective communities and increase civic engagement.

Overview:

Behavioral economics integrates psychology and economics to understand how humans make decisions and the reason for their behavior. If city officials can discern the underlying principles of what drives their citizensâ€™ behavior, they may encourage and reward behaviors that are consistent with their objectives. In order for that to be possible, we decided to gamify city interactions. Gamification is the technique of incorporating game-like elements into non-game environments to stimulate participation.

Our solution will have a huge economic impact and increase civic engagement. This is a win-win situation for both local business owners and citizens. By supporting local businesses, residents of a particular city will be rewarded. This will boost the city economy which will make it more sustainable and resilient. Rewards will be in the form of points, cashback rewards, or freebies from the local businesses. Aside from that, citizens will also be rewarded whenever they participate in local events, by expressing their ideas and opinions, and giving feedback to the local government.
